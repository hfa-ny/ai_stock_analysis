## How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Python 3.9:** Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed on your system. (The application is tested and designed for Python 3.9).
    *   **Google Gemini API Key:** You need a Google Gemini API key to use the AI analysis feature. See the **API Key Setup** section below.
    *   **Streamlit:** If running locally, ensure Streamlit is installed (`pip install streamlit`).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **API Key Setup:**
    *   **Streamlit Secrets (Recommended for Streamlit Cloud or local development):**
        *   Create a `.streamlit` directory in the root of your project if it doesn't exist.
        *   Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
        *   Add your Google Gemini API key to `secrets.toml` like this:
            ```toml
            GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
            ```
            **Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.**
        *   **Important Security Note:**  Do not commit `secrets.toml` to version control. Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` file.

    *   **Environment Variables (Recommended for Docker deployments):**
        *   When running the Docker container (see Docker section below), pass your API key as an environment variable:
            ```bash
            docker run -p 8501:8501 -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY" streamlit-stock-analysis
            ```
            The application code is set up to read the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from environment variables or Streamlit secrets.

5.  **Run the Streamlit App Locally:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

6.  **Using the Dashboard:**
    *   **Enter Stock Tickers:** In the sidebar, enter stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) separated by commas.
    *   **Select Date Range:** Choose a start and end date for the data.
    *   **Select Time Frame:** Choose a time frame for analysis (5min, 15min, 1hour, day, week). Note the warnings for intraday timeframes regarding data limitations.
    *   **Select Technical Indicators:** Choose the technical indicators you want to overlay on the charts.
    *   **Fetch Data:** Click the "Fetch Data" button in the sidebar.
    *   **View Analysis:** Once data is loaded, navigate through the tabs:
        *   **Overall Summary:**  See a table of stock tickers and their AI-generated recommendations.
        *   **Ticker-Specific Tabs:**  Each ticker will have its own tab with:
            *   Candlestick chart with selected indicators.
            *   AI-generated recommendation box.
            *   Detailed justification from the AI.
            *   (For intraday timeframes) Raw data table for inspection.

## Docker Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Docker:** Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t streamlit-stock-analysis .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY" streamlit-stock-analysis
    ```
    **Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"` with your actual Google Gemini API key.**

4.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Dev Container Instructions (VS Code)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **VS Code:**  Visual Studio Code is recommended.
    *   **Dev Containers Extension:** Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VS Code.
    *   **Docker:** Docker must be installed and running on your system.

2.  **Open Project in VS Code:** Open the project directory in VS Code.

3.  **Reopen in Dev Container:** VS Code should automatically detect the `.devcontainer` folder. Click on the "Reopen in Container" button when prompted (or use the command palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container").

4.  **Development Environment:** VS Code will build and start the Dev Container. You'll be working within an isolated and pre-configured development environment with all dependencies installed.

5.  **Run Streamlit App:** Open a terminal within VS Code (inside the Dev Container) and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Access the app at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## API Key Setup (Google Gemini API)

To use the AI-powered analysis, you need a Google Gemini API key.

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project:** If you don't have one, create a project in the Google Cloud Console ([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)).
2.  **Enable the Generative Language API:** In your Google Cloud project, enable the "Generative Language API".
3.  **Create API Credentials:** Create an API key for the Generative Language API in the "Credentials" section of the Google Cloud Console.
4.  **Securely Configure API Key:**
    *   For local development and Streamlit Cloud, use Streamlit Secrets (as described in the "How to Use" section).
    *   For Docker deployments, use Docker environment variables (as described in the "Docker Instructions" section).

**Important Security Note:** Treat your API key as sensitive information. Do not hardcode it directly in your scripts or commit it to public repositories.
